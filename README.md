# What They Say

We are on #hacktoberfest2018

### Resume
--------
We are using real time closed caption to support people with disability hearing
--------

### What is about it?
This project is a real time closed caption made to disability hearing people, but people without disability can use it to take notes.

We started this project with a reasearch of two friends deaf on [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/)

They found the project [speak-extension](https://github.com/charliegerard/speak-extension) by Chalie Gerard and we tried to implement something closer and more customized.

Now we have a name: "What Thet Say" and people helping =)

### What is our goal?

We would like this extension help people with disability hearing to watch talks, movies and whatever, in whole world, therefore we will be so happy =D
